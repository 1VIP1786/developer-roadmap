# Architectural Patterns

Architectural patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software architecture. They provide templates for organizing code structure and system components. Key patterns include:

1. Model-View-Controller (MVC): Separates data, user interface, and control logic
2. Microservices: Structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services
3. Layered Architecture: Organizes code into layers with distinct responsibilities
4. Event-Driven Architecture: Based on the production, detection, and consumption of events
5. Client-Server: Distributes workload between service providers (servers) and service requesters (clients)
6. Publish-Subscribe: Allows for loose coupling between components through message passing
7. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA): Structures applications as collections of interoperable services

These patterns guide developers in creating scalable, maintainable, and efficient software systems, each offering different benefits depending on the specific requirements and constraints of a project.
